% Part 1: affine_layer
%
% This script contains the class definition for an affine layer. It
% contains three functions a constructor, 'forward' and 'backward'. The
% constructor creates an appropriately sized and initialized weights
% matrix, which is stored as an object property obj.W. Forward and bacward 
% compute the forward- and back-propagation steps respectively. You will 
% need to fill out the sections marked 'TODO'.

classdef affine_layer
    % The properties section lists the variables associated with this layer
    % which are stored whenever the forward or backward methods are called.
    properties
        W       % Weights and bias matrix (params)
        x       % Input
        y       % Output
        dLdW    % Gradient of loss wrt params

            % Initialise weights using stddev sqrt(1/n_in). This is known
            % as He initialisation (He et al., 2015), and is used to
            % prevent the variance of the forward- and back-prop passes
            % from exploding or vanishing to zero.
