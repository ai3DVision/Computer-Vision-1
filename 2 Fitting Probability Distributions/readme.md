### Fitting Probability Models

Three different ways to fit probability distributions to data. We shall have a set of data points, X, for which we wish to learn the parameters for a given probability distribution. Here our data is one dimensional and continuous, so we shall focus on fitting a univariate normal distribution.

### A
Use maximum likelihood (ML) to find the parameters of the normal distribution which is most likely given the data.

### B
Introduce some prior information about the parameters and find the maximum a posteriori (MAP) fit.

### C
Parameter estimation from a Bayesian perspective.
