### Mixture of Gaussians

This project explores fitting simple parametric models to visual data.

### A
Fit one Gaussian model to the data for skin and another Gaussian to non-skin pixels. Use this to find the posterior probability that each pixel in an image is skin.

### B
Fit a mixture of Gaussians model to one dimensional data.

### C
Fit a mixture of Gaussians model to n-dimensional (RGB) data.
