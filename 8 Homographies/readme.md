### 1A
Calculate the homography that best maps two sets of points to one another.

### 1B
Use 1A to create a panorama from several images with a matching set of points.

### 2A
Take several points on a plane, and predict where they will appear in the camera image.
Based on these observed points, re-estimate the Euclidean transformation relating the plane and the camera.

### 2B
Draw a wireframe cube on an augmented reality marker.
